# A Draft Outline for Reproduction Analysis Report

## Introduction

- Establish the concept of reproduction and the purpose of doing reproduction analysis.
- Introduce the topic of interest (key words: people with disability, social inequity under public health crisis, etc.)
- Introduce the original study
  - The research questions of the original study
  - Briefly describe the variables used in the analysis and the type of statistical tests.
  - Results and the implication of results
  - Link to reproduction analysis
  - why is it relevant for us to reproduce Jay's paper now?
    - other research has already referenced this paper in subsequent studies
    - is disability still important in the context of COVID-19 impacts?
    - Jay's study was not computationally reproducible.
    - We are creating a GitHub repository with, data, R code, and metadata
	Our hypothesis and research goals
    - publish reproducible research compendium (using open source software for all the analysis)
    - confirm validity of study with significance for public health
	Briefly describe the organization of this reproduction analysis (part 1, 2, 3â€¦)

## Methods

### Measures
- Data sources
- Variables and their characteristics, spatial and temporal extents
- Variables transformation

### Analyses
- Part 1 - Choropleth map and descriptive statistics
- Part 2 - Bivariate analysis
- Part 3 - GEE

## Results
- Unplanned deviations in reproduction analysis
- Part 1 results
- Part 2 results
- Part 3 results

## Discussion
- Discuss geographic pattern of disability, and then geographic pattern of disability compared to COVID-19.
- Add discussion on ecological fallacy
